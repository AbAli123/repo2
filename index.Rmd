Hello, Class!

This page is created using GitHub Pages.  It's an option when you create a GitHub Repo. Basically any html files that GitHub finds (either in the main directory or under docs/ in this case) are rendered as a webpage.  In this case, the html files are generated from RMarkdown. To see the raw Github page, go to [https://github.com/abecode/631-rtopics](https://github.com/abecode/631-rtopics)

For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html. Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are _not_ based on **blogdown**. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use **blogdown** instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown.
